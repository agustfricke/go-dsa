# Data structures and algorithms in Go

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of various data structures and 
algorithms in Go. It serves as a resource for understanding and applying 
fundamental concepts in computer science using the Go programming language. 
Whether you are learning data structures, preparing for coding interviews, 
or looking to implement efficient algorithms in your Go projects, this 
repository provides practical examples and solutions.

## Run all the tests
```bash
go test ./... -v
```

## Array data structure
### Insert at the end
```bash
go test -v ./ds/array/insert_end_test.go
```

### Search
```bash
go test -v ./ds/array/search_test.go
```

### Delete 
```bash
go test -v ./ds/array/delete_test.go
```

### Insert at any position
```bash
go test -v ./ds/array/insert_any_test.go
```

## Linked list
### Singly linked list(Insert, Read, Search by index, Delete by index)
```bash
go test -v ./ds/linked_list/singly/singly_test.go
```
